Midterm - Final Project Outline

[Thematic](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/conflict_urbanism_sp2020)

For the purposes of the Conflict Urbanism Final Project, we intend to look at the Israeli settlement Har Homa through a lens of infrapolitics and the urbanization of warfare, exploring these concepts spatially in the context of Israeli occupation through the example of Har Homa. Conceived by former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the first half of the 1990s (Rosen, 2012, p. 36), *Har Homa* is situated on a hilltop in the southern parts of East Jerusalem - and is also referred to as ![Jabal Abu Ghneim](images/har_homa_images_for_site/har_homa_2.jpg). The settlement was particularly controversial from its inception, owing in part to the fact that it in part was built on Palestinian expropriated land (Greenberg, 1997).

Building on a solid theoretical underpinning - notably through Eyal Weizman’s theory of optical urbanism, and the notion of bypass urbanism, our project aims contextualize the conversation around these concepts in regard to the continued presence of **Israeli settlements** in the West Bank. Har Homa’s location on a hilltop, the topology of which is clearly mirrored in its urban layout, makes it a particularly appropriate example to illustrate the anatomy of an Israeli settlement. We aim to explore Har Homa through a topographical 3D modeling of the settlement, using it as the tool to expose underlying infrastructural connections between it and the wider Israeli settlement apparatus - as well as vis-à-vis Israel proper. We seek to address, among other things, transport links, water supply, and electrical grids - both on a systemic scale, as well as on a micro-scale pertaining to local conditions in the settlement.

For example, in the case of public transport, this includes both spatially map bus stops in Har Homa, as well as connections to the wider occupied Palestine as well as Israel. Put simply - we aim to spatially map the infrastructure anatomy of Israeli settlements.

Argumentational & theoretical underpinnings

A major theoretical underpinning of this exploration of Eyal Weizman’s idea of optical urbanism (Weizman, 2007, p. 111), as well as the idea of bypass urbanism. Optical urbanism relates to the idea of the shift in Israeli urban construction from the plains in Israel proper to the more mountainous regions of the Occupied Palestinian Territories - whereby settlements become urban frontiers against a perceived omnipresent enemy, and the its ‘topographical contours of [...] are retraced as lines of infrastructure’ (Weizman, p. 131). This notion of settlements as being an outpost is further echoed by Zvi Efrat in the context of Israel’s relationship to its borders - in what he calls the ‘vigilant civilian periphery’ (Efrat, 2018, p. 911). This framework helps us to frame our argumentation around the civilian outpost infrastructurally linked to Israel’s core. Larkin’s thoughts on infrapolitics are also guiding us in this exploration - notably around the idea of infrastructure as operating on several levels concurrently (Larkin, 2013, p. 335-336); added to this is also the idea of the ‘doubling’ of infrastructure. These sources will allow us to construct an argumentation clearly anchored in theories both on infrastructure and the urbanization of war.

Anticipated outcomes

Our project aims to as clearly and concisely as possible visualize previously elaborated ideas on Israeli settlements, that so far have not been represented through the medium of a case study - taking into account all facets of daily life through the idea of infrastructure and infrapolitics, and the urbanization of war. Masked through encoded objects and systems, we aim to deconstruct the idea of attempted normality and neutrality of the infrastructural systems of Har Homa - and by extension the wider Israeli settlement machinery. This unveiling of abstraction will enable a conversation to emanate around notions of citizenry, infrastructure, urban separation and warfare as well as complicity in relation to Israel and Palestine.

Mapping & data

The main product of our project will be a 3D visualization of Har Homa, which will enable us to pin various examples of how the settlements is an example of large-scale infrapolitics on the part of the Israeli government and the apparatus that is the occupation of the Palestinian Territories. The basis for this 3D rendering comes from a few different sources. One of these sources is Palestine Open Maps, which provides maps of our study area from the 1930s up until today - allowing us to compare growth over time, as well as accessing topographical data. Another is Google Maps and satellite imagery; a third is the original master plan of the architectural office put in charge of Har Homa - Kolker Kolker Epstein (see Fig.1 & Fig.2). The layering of these various maps allows us to produce our own topographic 3D model onto which we can later add buildings and infrastructural systems (Fig.3).

The content that will then inform how this rendering is populated will come from a number of data sources. One such source is population statistics for Israeli settlements as provided by B’Tselem - the The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories - where we can are able to track the population growth for Har Homa from 2003 up until 2016; a period that saw an increase from just over 2,000 inhabitants to over 20,000 (B’Tselem, Settlements Population, 2019). Google Maps is another key data source, both in terms of tracing road networks and bus routes, which will allow us to spatially represent these connections - but also in accessing a street view of Har Homa, finding evidence of electrical cabinets, water outlets, etc.

Architectural data is made available through this resource insofar as it provides us with images of how high structures were erected (this data differs from the original master plan by Kolker Kolker Epstein). Real estate websites are an alternative source of architectural data in that they provide floorplans, rendering and pictures of Har Homa’s apartments (see Fig.4 & Fig.5.). We have also been able to access fragmented data of Israel’s water network, as well as electrical grid, which further will inform our rendering. In addition to this, we seek to incorporate data on archaeological excavations in and around Har Homa - framing the infrastructure of archaeology as a legitimization of an Israeli presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (see Fig.6).
