In recent years, neighborhood rezonings have emerged as a flashpoint across New York City. In 2014, the de Blasio administration announced plans to rezone 15 neighborhoods across New York City to jump-start the city’s stock of affordable housing units. According to the administration, the neighborhood rezonings (many of which allowed for greater development capacity) would help the city reach its goal of creating 200,000 below-market-rate housing units by 2022.

In neighborhoods from Inwood to Bushwick, neighborhood residents and community activists have raised the alarm bell that rezonings induce gentrification and displacement pressures. According to opponents, rezonings often tend to raise property values, increasing rents and displacing low-income and minority households. Look no further than [East New York](https://citylimits.org/2016/03/10/some-suspect-east-new-york-rezoning-has-triggered-speculation/), activists reasoned, where real estate speculation, tenant harassment, and evictions accelerated at the first whisper that the NYC Department of City Planning was considering rezoning the neighborhood. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that rezonings might accelerate gentrification pressures, minimal empirical evidence in the literature has investigated what happens following a neighborhood rezoning.

This project explores one especially embattled rezonings in New York City–the rezoning of Jerome Avenue in the southwest Bronx–by examining three measures of displacement and dispossession. Specifically, this project asks: how did the three following measures of displacement activity change in the years leading up to and in the immediate aftermath of the Jerome Avenue Rezoning?

1. Real estate speculation activity
2. Residential and commercial evictions
3. Gains/losses in affordable housing units
 
#### Background on Jerome Avenue  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:
