In recent years, neighborhood rezonings have emerged as a flashpoint across New York City. In 2014, the de Blasio administration announced plans to rezone 15 neighborhoods across New York City to jump-start the city’s stock of affordable housing units. According to the administration, the neighborhood rezonings (many of which allowed for greater development capacity) would help the city reach its goal of creating 200,000 below-market-rate housing units by 2022.

In neighborhoods from Inwood to Bushwick, neighborhood residents and community activists have raised the alarm bell that rezonings induce gentrification and displacement pressures. According to opponents, rezonings often tend to raise property values, increasing rents and displacing low-income and minority households. Look no further than [East New York](https://citylimits.org/2016/03/10/some-suspect-east-new-york-rezoning-has-triggered-speculation/), activists reasoned, where real estate speculation, tenant harassment, and evictions accelerated at the first whisper that the NYC Department of City Planning was considering rezoning the neighborhood. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that rezonings might accelerate gentrification pressures, minimal empirical evidence in the literature has investigated what happens following a neighborhood rezoning.

This project explores one especially embattled rezonings in New York City–the rezoning of Jerome Avenue in the southwest Bronx–by examining three measures of displacement and dispossession. Specifically, this project asks: how did the three following measures of displacement activity change in the years leading up to and in the immediate aftermath of the Jerome Avenue Rezoning?

1. Real estate speculation activity
2. Residential and commercial evictions
3. Affordable housing production
 
#### Background on Jerome Avenue

Jerome Avenue sits in the southwestern Bronx, running north to south through Highbridge, Mount Eden, Concourse, Mount Hope, University Heights, and Morris Heights. Historically, Jerome Avenue developed as a service district, providing parking and commercial services to the predominantly residential neighborhoods that surround the area. Existing zoning permits heavy commercial and light industrial uses along most of Jerome Avenue, and as a result, low-scale retail and industrial establishments line the corridor.

Jerome Avenue has been heavily shaped by the highways that snake throughout the Bronx. For example, an exit to the Cross Bronx Expressway and empties directly onto the avenue, providing easy access to the district. As a result, auto-related businesses began to cluster along the corridor, and Jerome Avenue remains one of the most vibrant homes of auto-related businesses in the city.

Tire shops, auto-repair shops, and gas stations are among some of the common sites in the area.

The Jerome Avenue corridor is also home to a rich array of family and immigrant-owned businesses. Many of these businesses cater to the predominantly Spanish-speaking communities living in the residential neighborhoods surrounding Jerome Avenue.

#### Jerome Avenue Rezoning

In 2015, the NYC Department of City Planning announced the planned rezoning of Jerome Avenue, arguing that the rezoning would help protect and preserve the neighborhood’s stock of affordable housing, revitalize existing retail businesses, improve existing park and open space opportunities, and support workforce development in the neighborhood. The NYC Department of City Planning identified Jerome Avenue as an ideal site for a rezoning because the city argued that the area could support increased residential density. Second, the city argued that the area features prime transit access, being served by the 4, B, and D train lines and several highways.

As the rezoning moved through the city’s land use review process, the NYC Department of City Planning hosted over 40 public events with thousands of residents. This public engagement process culminated in the release of Jerome Avenue Neighborhood Plan, which provided a framework to guide future planning and policy action in the neighborhood. With the release of the plan, the city committed to investing approximately $189 million in capital projects in the neighborhood. After surrounding community boards, the Bronx Borough President, and the City Planning Commission approved the rezoning, the City Council approved the rezoning in March 2018.


Yet, the rezoning quickly emerged as a site of conflict as it moved through the city’s land use review process, following the path of other embattled rezoning plans in NYC. Opponents charged that the rezonings caused displacement, pointing to rapid rent increases and real estate speculation in other NYC neighborhoods that have undergone rezonings. In particular, opponents argued that the rezoning would place strain on the auto-related businesses that have long anchored Jerome Avenue and that tend to be staffed by low-income households and immigrants.

The Bronx Coalition for a Community Vision, a coalition of residents; religious groups; and unions representing workers at auto-related businesses, emerged as one of the most vocal opponents of the rezoning. The organization advocated that 100% of new units constructed along Jerome Avenue would be below-market-rate and called on the city to develop a more authentic public engagement process.

#### Methodology & Datasets

In order to investigate how various measures of displacement activity changed in the years surrounding the Jerome Avenue rezoning, I leveraged datasets from several sources. 

First, using data from the NYC Department of City Planning, I examined changes in real estate assessment values in the Jerome Avenue corridor between 2015 and 2020 to understand whether the rezoning induced real estate speculation pressures. Second, I leveraged a dataset from the NYC Department of Investigation to examine the landscape of residential and commercial evictions between 2018 and 2019. Last, I used data from the NYC Department of Housing Preservation & Development to examine new affordable housing units constructed between 2016 and 2019.

#### Changes in Property Values

The map below presents changes in property values along the Jerome Avenue corridor between 2015 and 2020. From 2015, when the Jerome Avenue rezoning was initially announced to two years after the rezoning, property values increased on average by 241%. This followed city and borough-level trends towards a precipitous increase in property values. Within the study area, residential properties rose at a much faster rate than commercial properties; residential property values increased by 176% in the study period compared to 44% among commercial properties.

Although property values were rising across the Bronx and across the city during the same time period, these findings provide some support to opponents’ claims that the Jerome Ave rezoning would induce real estate speculation pressures and raise surrounding property values given that the Jerome Ave corridor historically has not been an area that has experienced significant investment.

#### Residential and Commercial Evictions

The map below presents the landscape of commercial and residential evictions in the study area (pictured in yellow) and the surrounding three zip codes between 2018 and 2020. In the two years after the rezoning of Jerome Avenue, approximately 2,500 households and businesses were evicted. These evictions accounted for about a third of all evictions across the Bronx.

Roughly one in five evictions in the study area were commercial evictions, reflecting the heavily commercial character of Jerome Avenue. Several of the businesses that were evicted served auto-related uses, consistent with rezoning opponents’ claims that auto-related businesses would face acute displacement pressures.

Although these evictions provide a lens into the landscape of evictions following the Jerome Ave rezoning, it is worth noting that the evictions presented here likely represent a fraction of total evictions happening across the Bronx. Tenant advocacy organizations such as JustFix.nyc and the Anti-Eviction Mapping project have called attention to the ways in which existing public datasets often underreport evictions and have supplemented public datasets through their own investigative research.

#### Affordable Housing Production

The map below presents newly constructed affordable housing units in the years immediately following the Jerome Avenue rezoning. Between 2018 and 2019, roughly 1,400 new affordable housing units were added to the Jerome Ave corridor. The majority of the new units targeted households at the lowest end of the income spectrum, with roughly one-third of new affordable units for extremely low-income households and one-fifth of new affordable units for very low-income households.

![Figure 9](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/jerome_ave_11.png)

In some respects, the roughly 1,400 affordable housing units created as part of the Jerome Ave rezoning make a substantial dent in the roughly 3,250 affordable units that the city planned to add to the neighborhood, many of which would be permanently affordable units. Despite these inroads on affordable housing production, critics have charged that the newly affordable housing developments still might not be affordable enough to the neighborhoods impacted by the Jerome Ave rezoning, which have a median household income between $20 and $30K. Moreover, as others scholars have pointed out, affordable units that are created through the city’s mandatory inclusionary housing policy often do not benefit the very residents that are immediately displaced as a result of rezoning activity given the long lag time needed for new affordable housing construction. This raises the question not only of whether the Jerome Ave rezoning will provide sufficient new affordable housing, but also raises the question of who will benefit from this new affordable housing.

#### Conclusion

In recent years, neighborhood rezonings have emerged as a hot-button issue across New York City. Opponents have argued that rezonings usher in a wave of luxury development and tend to accelerate gentrification and displacement pressures. Yet, minimal research shows what happens following a rezoning. This project outlines a methodology for examining how three measures of displacement activity change following a rezoning, looking at property value change, residential and commercial evictions, and affordable housing production.

While this analysis is not causal, it does provide some support to rezoning opponents’ fears that rezonings will exacerbate gentrification pressures. As this analysis showed, property values and evictions continued to uptick following the rezoning.
