#### Introduction  
The conflict we address is extractive urbanism, a model for development of new cities. Many places rich in natural resources have reaped great benefits by simply exploiting and exporting themselves.  

Urban construction of these places is aiming to reinforce this low-cost money-making cycle. Called extractive urbanism. Sounds exciting, but considering who exactly benefits in this capital game, stories are not so rosy.  

Africa’s urban population will almost triple in the coming 35 years, with more than 1.3 billion Africans living in cities by 2050. But the initial driving force of these urban growth, is more a desire finding fiscal reservoir from external capital, than a natural increasing demand. And it is in this particular economic form of foreign investment orientation that African cities are rising from the ground up. (Image & Charts)
Mozambique is one of the shining stars. The country's economy has taken off from relying on foreign direct investment, which is now turning into controlling domestic resources and making profits by exporting them abroad.  

Nearly 70 per cent of capital flows in exports come from the mining and mining supporting industries, logistics, energy producing, etc. And the spatial byproducts of this economic model is the rising of Mozambique's new cities. Tete, an interior city of Mozambique, which owns several largest mines. Palma in Cabo Delgado, a  future center of gas mining. Cuamba, Montepuez, Mulevala, Manica and Chibuto.  

If we spatially position large mining and mining serving companies, they are highly aligned with those rising cities.However, when we look at the nationality of these companies, only less than 40% of them are owned by Mozambican people. Taking a step closer, in terms of annual profits, most of the highest value creating ones do not belong to Mozambicans.  

And several interesting numbers need to be mentioned questioning who actually benefits from this extractive economy model. For the largest aluminum mining company Mozal in Mozambique,“Initial investment in Mozal amounted to 40% of GDP but only created around 1,500 direct jobs, with nearly one third held by foreigners (Quote)”, and “it is estimated that from the US$1.2 billion revenue posted per year, only US$200 million enters the Mozambican economy (Quote)”. And the ratio of Mozambican people living under the basic poverty line is 46.1 percent (Diagram).  

Here are parts of mega extractive projects we have mapped out in previous slides. Viewed from an altitude of 4,000 meters, these are the original seeds of Mozambican’s extractive economy and urban development.

#### City Scale Research | Moatize, Tete Province, Mozambique  
In the second chapter, we zoom into the city scale and further research on one called Moatize in Tete, which owns several largest mines. And another one is called Palma in Cabo Delgado, a potential natural gas mining center.  

**Brief Introduction of Coal Mining**  
In Mozambique, coal mining is the fastest growing industrial segment. Significant reserves of coking coal have been discovered in the Tete province, which have attracted numbers of prominent foreign mining companies.
As you can see, according to Business Monitor International report, coal production in Mozambique has been rapidly increasing since 2009. And also make Mozambique itself rank among the top 10 largest coal production and export countries in the world.

**Leading Companies and Their Investment in related Key Infrastructure**  
Foreign investments are not only developing mines in the country, but also constructing key infrastructure to facilitate export of mining commodities.  
As the map shows, Brazilian Company Vale Mining has invested in developing railroad projects — the Sena railroad, the Nacala corridor for transporting coal from the Moatize mine to the sea port like City Beira and Nacala for exports.  
The Cahora Bassa Dam marked in the map is another key infrastructure located in Tete Province, used to convert the Zambezi River power into electricity. Partial energy generated is then sent to mines in order to support extraction activities.

**Tete Province with Exploration Licenses**  
Zooming into Tete province. Tete is a "commodity extraction frontier" rich in coal. It holds an estimated 23 billion tons of mostly untapped coal reserves, with the natural resource boom still in its early stages. Here comes the 1st major conflicts: Land Acquisition.  
Mining concessions and exploration licenses approved by the government cover around 34% of Tete province land.  
Including licenses pending approval, around 60% of the province's land are covered.

**Moatize**  
Finally we come to Moatize, which is a district of Tete Province. Almost all of the district’s land is divided and licensed to FDI.  

![description of image](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/extractive_moz/Moatize_03.jpg)  

**Resettlement**  
Vale Mining and Rio Tinto are major extraction companies which have been producing coal from the Moatize mine since 2011, and planned to have further expansion.// Due to the current extraction and expansion, many families have been displaced. Over a thousand families resettled approximately 60 km away from the Moatize coal mining site.

**Complaints**  
The local population of Tete province has suffered from the coal boom, since large-scale resettlements have been taking place since 2009. As a consequence, the communities have faced disruptions in accessing food, water and work.  
Living conditions have decreased drastically, as many farming households who had “previously been living along a river” and were therefore “self-sufficient”, have now been resettled to sites far away from the markets in Moatize, with agricultural land of  “uneven quality and unreliable access to water”. “Food insecurity and dependence on food assistance” provided by the mining companies has become a serious issue for the families.

#### City Scale Research | Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique  
**Cabo Delgado | Revuma Gas Fields**  
In 2010, large reserves of natural gas were discovered in the Rovuma Basin, the offshore area of Cabo Delgado Province, northern Mozambique, which attracted a lot of foreign investment and will make Mozambique the third largest country of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). There are also future plans for pipeline and natural gas plants, yet it remains unknown who will invest in this development. However, the existing pipeline plan in Maputo is going to transport huge natural gas to South Africa.  

![description of image](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/extractive_moz/Cabo_01.jpg)  

**Cabo Delgado | Licensed Gas Areas**  
The Gas Fields were divided into onshore and offshore 6 areas held by different foreign companies, and a lot of those are owned by foreign governments. In each area, Mozambique holds 10-15 percent shares, but none of the areas is operated by Mozambique. In fact, most of LNG will be shipped to those countries instead of being locally used. To support the LNG production, an onshore facility will be constructed, which is projected to influence over 10,000 People.

**Afungi LNG Plant | Resettlement Plan**  
A Resettlement plan was made for the construction of  the LNG plant, over 500 households are expected to be physically resettled and another 1000 are expected to lose access to their economic resource. The replacement village is located at the marginal area of the plant, but the replacement agricultural land will be 10-15 km away, and there is a delay in this process while the replacement village is being constructed now.

**Afungi LNG Plant | Loss of Main Source of Livelihoods**  
Among the displaced households, 51% are engaging in fishing, and in coastal villages, the number can be more than 80%. This map shows the vessel fishing and intertidal collecting points as well as the home ports. The restricted marine area will have a huge impact on those fishing grounds.  

![description of image](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/extractive_moz/Cabo_04.jpg)

**Afungi LNG Plant | Development in Place**  
As part of the resettlement plan, the project promised to provide more social services to the local people, However, there are concerns that the construction of the facilities is happening much faster than that of their supporting social services, which can be true through the satellite images.  

![description of image](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/extractive_moz/Cabo_05.gif)  

**Cabo Delgado | Emerging Insurgency**  
Apart from the loss of livelihoods, there are also rising security concerns about the emerging attacks since 2017. A series of attacks by Islamist extremists on the civilians have causing dozens people killed. In 2019, they started to target LNG projects. The big companies have been seeking more troops from the government for protection. The ongoing conflict between the insurgents and the military forces have been bringing more pressure to the people who already have a relatively low socio-economic background in the poorest region. People are afraid of going to their fields, and the displaced households with a far allocated field will face potential starvation.

#### Infrastructure Research | Cahora Bassa Dam  
Similar to the extraction industries, large-scale supporting infrastructures in Mozambique are often built by foreign capitals. They are mostly done as a point-to-point model, in favor of lowering the cost of transportation and export of the extracted resources, thus often flying through a great area of territory without any connection to the surroundings.  

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Power Generation and Distribution**  
The electricity system is one of the examples. In 2014, the country generated 2,626 MW electricity, of which 79% are contributed by the hydropower at Cahora Bassa dam in Tete Province. At 187 gigawatts, Mozambique has the largest power generation potential in Southern Africa from untapped coal, hydro, gas, wind and solar resources. Mozambique is a major exporter of hydropower, coal and natural gas, with the aim of becoming southern Africa’s energy hub.
&nbsp;
On the other hand, Mozambique faces substantial challenges in reaching its goal of universal energy access. Its energy access rate is among the lowest of sub-Saharan countries. In a planned future, Mozambique will still sell most of its energy output to South Africa and the Southern African Power Pool, with only a small portion remaining for domestic consumption.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Domestic Power Access**  
Despite the outsized energy generation, there’s a huge gap between the demand and the distribution. Extraction and export segments are among the top priorities of power supply while the whole system is struggling with the existing highly subsidized tariffs.
&nbsp;
There are 4.1 million households with no power access in Mozambique. The current access rate for residence is 29%. This number is 57% in urban areas and 15% in rural areas, yet only 36.5% of the country’s people live in a city.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Cahora Bassa | Inbalanced Energy Distribution**  
At the heart of Mozambique’s energy system is Cahora Bassa, the giant hydroelectric dam on the Zambezi River in Tete province, opened in 1977. As a colonial legacy, this project is ﬁnanced by foreign investors and the guaranteed sale of electricity to South Africa at below-market prices, in exchange for its support in the colonial war.
&nbsp;
In the post civil war era, Cahora Bassa was taken over by the Mozambique government and rendered as a symbol of national identity - ‘o orgulho de Moçambique (the pride of Mozambique)’.
&nbsp;
But as a major source of revenue income, annually 70% of the dam’s output has been committed to South Africa’s Eskom utility under a long-term agreement through 2029. A large portion of that is later reimported to Mozambique to serve large extraction industries owned by foreign shareholders. Beyond that, the country plans to expand sales to Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania. This all happens with a majority of the domestic population still having no access to electricity.
