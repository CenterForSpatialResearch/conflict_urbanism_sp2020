#### Introduction  
The conflict we address is extractive urbanism, a model for development of new cities. Many places rich in natural resources have reaped great benefits by simply exploiting and exporting themselves.  

Urban construction of these places is aiming to reinforce this low-cost money-making cycle. Called extractive urbanism. Sounds exciting, but considering who exactly benefits in this capital game, stories are not so rosy.  

Africa’s urban population will almost triple in the coming 35 years, with more than 1.3 billion Africans living in cities by 2050. But the initial driving force of these urban growth, is more a desire finding fiscal reservoir from external capital, than a natural increasing demand. And it is in this particular economic form of foreign investment orientation that African cities are rising from the ground up. (Image & Charts)
P5 Mozambique is one of the shining stars. The country's economy has taken off from relying on foreign direct investment, which is now turning into controlling domestic resources and making profits by exporting them abroad.  

Nearly 70 per cent of capital flows in exports come from the mining and mining supporting industries, logistics, energy producing, etc. And the spatial byproducts of this economic model is the rising of Mozambique's new cities.  

Tete, an interior city of Mozambique, which owns several largest mines. Palma in Cabo Delgado, a  future center of gas mining. Cuamba, Montepuez, Mulevala, Manica and Chibuto.  

If we spatially position large mining and mining serving companies, they are highly aligned with those rising cities.  

However, when we look at the nationality of these companies, only less than 40% of them are owned by Mozambican people.  

Taking a step closer, in terms of annual profits, most of the highest value creating ones do not belong to Mozambicans.  

And several interesting numbers need to be mentioned questioning who actually benefits from this extractive economy model. For the largest aluminum mining company Mozal in Mozambique,“Initial investment in Mozal amounted to 40% of GDP but only created around 1,500 direct jobs, with nearly one third held by foreigners (Quote)”, and “it is estimated that from the US$1.2 billion revenue posted per year, only US$200 million enters the Mozambican economy (Quote)”. And the ratio of Mozambican people living under the basic poverty line is 46.1 percent (Diagram).  

Here are parts of mega extractive projects we have mapped out in previous slides. Viewed from an altitude of 4,000 meters, these are the original seeds of Mozambican’s extractive economy and urban development.

#### City Scale Research | Moatize, Tete Province, Mozambique  
In the second chapter, we zoom into the city scale and further research on one called Moatize in Tete, which owns several largest mines. And another one is called Palma in Cabo Delgado, a potential natural gas mining center.  

**Brief Introduction of Coal Mining**  
In Mozambique, coal mining is the fastest growing industrial segment. Significant reserves of coking coal have been discovered in the Tete province, which have attracted numbers of prominent foreign mining companies.
As you can see, according to Business Monitor International report, coal production in Mozambique has been rapidly increasing since 2009. And also make Mozambique itself rank among the top 10 largest coal production and export countries in the world.

**Leading Companies and Their Investment in related Key Infrastructure**  
Foreign investments are not only developing mines in the country, but also constructing key infrastructure to facilitate export of mining commodities.  
As the map shows, Brazilian Company Vale Mining has invested in developing railroad projects — the Sena railroad, the Nacala corridor for transporting coal from the Moatize mine to the sea port like City Beira and Nacala for exports.  
The Cahora Bassa Dam marked in the map is another key infrastructure located in Tete Province, used to convert the Zambezi River power into electricity. Partial energy generated is then sent to mines in order to support extraction activities.

**Tete Province with Exploration Licenses**  
Zooming into Tete province. Tete is a "commodity extraction frontier" rich in coal. It holds an estimated 23 billion tons of mostly untapped coal reserves, with the natural resource boom still in its early stages. Here comes the 1st major conflicts: Land Acquisition.  
Mining concessions and exploration licenses approved by the government cover around 34% of Tete province land.  
Including licenses pending approval, around 60% of the province's land are covered.

**Moatize**  
Finally we come to Moatize, which is a district of Tete Province. Almost all of the district’s land is divided and licensed to FDI.

**Resettlement**  
Vale Mining and Rio Tinto are major extraction companies which have been producing coal from the Moatize mine since 2011, and planned to have further expansion.// Due to the current extraction and expansion, many families have been displaced. Over a thousand families resettled approximately 60 km away from the Moatize coal mining site.

**Complaints**  
The local population of Tete province has suffered from the coal boom, since large-scale resettlements have been taking place since 2009. As a consequence, the communities have faced disruptions in accessing food, water and work.  
Living conditions have decreased drastically, as many farming households who had “previously been living along a river” and were therefore “self-sufficient”, have now been resettled to sites far away from the markets in Moatize, with agricultural land of  “uneven quality and unreliable access to water”. “Food insecurity and dependence on food assistance” provided by the mining companies has become a serious issue for the families.
