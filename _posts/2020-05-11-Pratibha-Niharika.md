Water is one of the most basic needs for survival, but it also fuels commerce, trade and economic advancements. Water insecurity continues to be an indicator of instability in many regions of the Indian subcontinent, leading to shortage of drinking water, agriculture and food causing forced displacement and destruction of livelihoods. Usually these water bodies help form natural boundaries, and in several cases their access is shared by adjacent entities. The problem between transboundary water bodies is that the upstream regions can at any moment reduce, stop or pollute the flow of water to the downstream regions. This transforms water reserves into a competitive resource giving way to what is known as “Water World wars''. The theme of our project is to understand this hydropolitics in the Indian subcontinent, looking at the different scales of inter- and intra- hydropolitics and their varied repercussions.

The river was no longer what appeared as “natural”, it had become the only lifeline for millions of people, separated by a politically charged line, giving birth to the volatile hydropolitics in the Indian subcontinent, and its varied repercussions at different scales between and within the nations.


#### Case Study : Indus River


On Feb 20 2019, India announced the decision to block the flow of water from three tributaries of the Indus river into Pakistan, days after the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 soldiers were killed in Kashmir by a suicide bomber from Pakistan.

#### Water as Conflict


With the rapid increase in water scarcity exacerbated by the climate crisis, explosive population growth is straining world resources, and hyper-nationalism is testing diplomatic relations, water demand is expected to go up 55% between 2000 and 2050.

Water insecurity continues to be an indicator of instability in many regions of South Asia, leading to shortage of drinking water, agriculture and food causing forced displacement and destruction of livelihoods. 

Usually these water bodies help form natural boundaries, and in several cases their access is shared by adjacent entities. The problem between transboundary water bodies is that the upstream regions can at any moment reduce, stop or pollute the flow of water to the downstream regions. This transforms water reserves into a competitive resource giving way to what is known as “Water Wars''. 

Shared river basins require cooperation to maintain peace. But these water resources of the Indian subcontinent are ill-managed, where the natural flow of water is disturbed by built infrastructures for diversion and/or containment. 

The race to capitalize on this abundant natural resource has resulted in self-inflicted disaster, which has led to unequitable scarcity of water in many areas, and increased instances of flooding and riverbank erosion in others, impacting the daily lives of millions of people and therefore laying the seeds to conflict. This has consequently resulted in political interventions to manage resource allocation and control over the river.

**War for water, the next World war?**


#### Water Insecurity


For Pakistan, with its semi-arid climate and erratic rainfall patterns that get increasingly unpredictable every year due to effects of climate change, the availability of this resource


#### Irrigation


The dependence on the Indus for irrigation dates back to the early civilizations of Mohenjodaro and Harappa. These systems were transformed by modern engineering work in the 1850s and further expanded and upgraded under the British occupation of India, into the largest and most complex canal irrigation system in the world. The attribution for most of this comprehensive infrastructure is given to Sir Arthur Cotton, who believed that in order to properly utilize the fluvial resource, it was important “to establish canals for irrigation wherever they were practicable, and to supersede rain and well-water by river water, which carried with it fertilizing matter greatly augmenting its value as compared with all other water.”
Pakistan is an agrarian economy, with over 90% of harvests within the country depending on this extensive canal network, which spans over an area of 36 million acres. According to Pakistan Economic Survey data, the agriculture sector of the country employs 42% of the entire labour force of the nation, which evidently illustrates the importance of the water sources from the Indus for the country.
