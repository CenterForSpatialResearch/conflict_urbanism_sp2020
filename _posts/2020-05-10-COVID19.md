It is May 8, 2020 and the coronavirus pandemic steadily continues on its disruptive path. It is a conflict of growing proportions that, in a few short months, became the primary structuring principle of organisms, societies, cities, and infrastructural and global networks. Though the “end” is far from sight,  we know that conflict can be destructive and also constructive when it comes to our environments. Prompted by the theme of this course, the architecture school and university we share, and the simple fact that “we’re living it,” this project aims to reflect upon and analyze the documented aspects of the novel coronavirus in order to better understand the present spatial effects and future implications.

The project shares insights into the chronology of unprecedented events; a lexicon of spatial terminology indigenous to the pandemic; a defense of the efficacy of the “Flatten-the-curve” movement; and deeper reflections on the data, methods, and visualizations circulating at present.

#### Dispersion
On March 12, 2020, the President of Columbia University, Lee Bollinger, issued the following statement: “in order to reduce the density of our residential environment, while respecting the interests and needs of students who have reason to continue to remain in residence on campus, we are instituting three critical decisions: (1) The University will remain open and functioning; (2) All classes for the remainder of the semester will be conducted online; and (3) We encourage any students who are able to move out of undergraduate residence halls for the rest of the semester to do so.” Thus, there were many cancelled spring break plans (March 16-20) due to the mounting travel restrictions. On March 11 the U.S. barred the entry of all foreign nationals who had visited China, Iran and a group of European countries during the previous 14 days. The State Department on March 19 raised its global travel advisory to a Level 4, a recommendation that U.S. citizens either remain in place or return home. While on March 20, the White House Coronavirus Task Force said it was closing the border with Mexico and Canada to any nonessential travel, beginning March 21. By March 27, most students left Columbia to work remotely.  Some went home, others stayed in New York. 

Our awareness of the crisis evolved over time as restrictions and cancellations progressed. In an exercise early in the forming of this project, we found the act of mapping Columbia University and GSAPP events useful in understanding the multitude of personal and institutional circumstances.

#### Section 2
Moving beyond our class’s dispersion, beyond the University’s timeline and lens through which to observe the crisis, our following explorations attempt to represent at minimum three critical demographics: Essential Workers, non-essential workers, and those who have experienced serious disruptions to their livelihood on account of falling ill or having a close relation compromised by the virus. From the many mediums and platforms broadcasting information about COVID-19, a lexicon of spatial terms continues to emerge and shape the way we understand the current and potential effects of the pandemic on the urban environment. As part of this project’s efforts to keep up, we collected these terms throughout March and April with input from our classmates and extensive online research. After a critical mass was reached, we sought to classify our findings as a form of analysis: scalar divisions added another dimension to the old, new, and ever-changing definitions and uses of these words.

#### Flatten the Curve  
A widely circulated diagram serves as an organizing principle for the spatial terms within the various scales.  

![FlattenTheCurvePng](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/FlattentheCurveDiagram.png)  

The flatten the curve diagram started to become popular in early March after microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles and illustrator Toby Morris circulated a clear GIF that emphasizes the importance of preventing the spread with simple actions. The diagram charts two projected outcomes of COVID-19 and the healthcare system. The high peak  illustrates the catastrophic outcomes that come from taking no preventative measures and the spread infecting people beyond the capacity of the healthcare system (shown in purple). Whereas the second peak highlights how the curve would look when taking preventative measures, in which the number of infected cases can drastically be reduced by small actions that avoid the spread (shown in blue). This diagram emphasizes the combination of the threat of COVID-19’s high contagion spread combined with the limitations of the healthcare system. 

The diagram disseminates the two scenarios simply and not mathematically, becoming a powerful tool to educate and spread the news. As a result, we now find a large diversity of the same diagram, in different languages, some with added information, some through a more fun and creative lens, etc.

![FlattenTheCurvePersonal](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/PersonalCurve.jpg) 

Actions taken at the Personal Scale result in a flattening of the epidemic curve and a potential lowering of the healthcare system capacity line. Individuals abiding by social distancing protocol like maintaining six feet of separation or working from home decreases the potential number of cases by minimizing unnecessary contact with others. If healthcare workers follow similar principles (ie. self-quarantining if potentially exposed to the virus), they would be required to remove themselves from the frontline for a dedicated period of time therefore decreasing the healthcare system capacity.

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:
