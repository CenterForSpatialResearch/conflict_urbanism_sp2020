It is May 8, 2020 and the coronavirus pandemic steadily continues on its disruptive path. It is a conflict of growing proportions that, in a few short months, became the primary structuring principle of organisms, societies, cities, and infrastructural and global networks. Though the “end” is far from sight,  we know that conflict can be destructive and also constructive when it comes to our environments. Prompted by the theme of this course, the architecture school and university we share, and the simple fact that “we’re living it,” this project aims to reflect upon and analyze the documented aspects of the novel coronavirus in order to better understand the present spatial effects and future implications.

The project shares insights into the chronology of unprecedented events; a lexicon of spatial terminology indigenous to the pandemic; a defense of the efficacy of the “Flatten-the-curve” movement; and deeper reflections on the data, methods, and visualizations circulating at present.

#### Dispersion
![DispersionGif](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/DispersionGif.gif)  
On March 12, 2020, the President of Columbia University, Lee Bollinger, issued the following statement: “in order to reduce the density of our residential environment, while respecting the interests and needs of students who have reason to continue to remain in residence on campus, we are instituting three critical decisions: (1) The University will remain open and functioning; (2) All classes for the remainder of the semester will be conducted online; and (3) We encourage any students who are able to move out of undergraduate residence halls for the rest of the semester to do so.” Thus, there were many cancelled spring break plans (March 16-20) due to the mounting travel restrictions. On March 11 the U.S. barred the entry of all foreign nationals who had visited China, Iran and a group of European countries during the previous 14 days. The State Department on March 19 raised its global travel advisory to a Level 4, a recommendation that U.S. citizens either remain in place or return home. While on March 20, the White House Coronavirus Task Force said it was closing the border with Mexico and Canada to any nonessential travel, beginning March 21. By March 27, most students left Columbia to work remotely.  Some went home, others stayed in New York. 

Our awareness of the crisis evolved over time as restrictions and cancellations progressed. In an exercise early in the forming of this project, we found the act of mapping Columbia University and GSAPP events useful in understanding the multitude of personal and institutional circumstances.

#### Section 2
Moving beyond our class’s dispersion, beyond the University’s timeline and lens through which to observe the crisis, our following explorations attempt to represent at minimum three critical demographics: Essential Workers, non-essential workers, and those who have experienced serious disruptions to their livelihood on account of falling ill or having a close relation compromised by the virus. From the many mediums and platforms broadcasting information about COVID-19, a lexicon of spatial terms continues to emerge and shape the way we understand the current and potential effects of the pandemic on the urban environment. As part of this project’s efforts to keep up, we collected these terms throughout March and April with input from our classmates and extensive online research. After a critical mass was reached, we sought to classify our findings as a form of analysis: scalar divisions added another dimension to the old, new, and ever-changing definitions and uses of these words.

#### Flatten the Curve  
A widely circulated diagram serves as an organizing principle for the spatial terms within the various scales.  

![FlattenTheCurvePng](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/FlattentheCurveDiagram.png)  

The flatten the curve diagram started to become popular in early March after microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles and illustrator Toby Morris circulated a clear GIF that emphasizes the importance of preventing the spread with simple actions. The diagram charts two projected outcomes of COVID-19 and the healthcare system. The high peak  illustrates the catastrophic outcomes that come from taking no preventative measures and the spread infecting people beyond the capacity of the healthcare system (shown in purple). Whereas the second peak highlights how the curve would look when taking preventative measures, in which the number of infected cases can drastically be reduced by small actions that avoid the spread (shown in blue). This diagram emphasizes the combination of the threat of COVID-19’s high contagion spread combined with the limitations of the healthcare system. 

The diagram disseminates the two scenarios simply and not mathematically, becoming a powerful tool to educate and spread the news. As a result, we now find a large diversity of the same diagram, in different languages, some with added information, some through a more fun and creative lens, etc.

![FlattenTheCurvePersonal](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/PersonalCurve.jpg) 

Actions taken at the Personal Scale result in a flattening of the epidemic curve and a potential lowering of the healthcare system capacity line. Individuals abiding by social distancing protocol like maintaining six feet of separation or working from home decreases the potential number of cases by minimizing unnecessary contact with others. If healthcare workers follow similar principles (ie. self-quarantining if potentially exposed to the virus), they would be required to remove themselves from the frontline for a dedicated period of time therefore decreasing the healthcare system capacity.  

<img width="200" alt="personal01" src="/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/Personal01.jpg" onmouseover="this.src='/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/Personal01-01.jpg'" onmouseout="this.src='/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/Personal01.jpg'">  <img width="200" alt="personal02" src="/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/Personal02.jpg" onmouseover="this.src='/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/Personal02-01.jpg'" onmouseout="this.src='/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/Personal02.jpg'">  <img width="200" alt="personal03" src="/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/Personal03.jpg" onmouseover="this.src='/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/Personal03-01.jpg'" onmouseout="this.src='/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/Personal03.jpg'">

The Personal Scale encompasses an individual’s agency and concerns. The virus spreads through contact between healthy and infected persons, therefore governments and institutions mandate distancing. Work-from-home or remote-learning requirements promote dispersion of large concentrations of people. Occupancy restrictions limit the number of people allowed to gather in or enter one place. Maintaining six feet apart from strangers provides a buffer for contagious symptoms. But how do these new rules augment an individual’s experience of personal space?  
 
For non-essential workers, operation within one’s personal space becomes an act of reducing the risk of exposure by physically removing oneself from contact with other people. Essential workers navigate hygienic measures intended to cleanse their personal space between shifts—between moments when risk of exposure from strangers is high to moments of being the greatest risk for their families and/or relations. Falling ill, or caring for someone else who is ill, amplifies the adherence to the new guidelines for social distancing and cleanliness. In all spheres, routines have been upended and therefore personal space has taken on new meaning and value.  

While all of the new measures are proposed in the service of protecting one’s physical health, the Personal Scale also makes evident the effect of the pandemic on a subconscious level. The adjustments necessary to follow distancing practices affects mental health, habits, and the spaces we inhabit.  

**Rhetorics of Isolation Enforcement**  
In the United States, restrictions and guidelines in response to COVID-19 with spatiotemporal effects vary across borders, yet repeat similar phrases: shelter in place and stay home. The primary differences between the phrases lie in their historical use and nuances of the English language. The language of the measures matter insofar as how the public reacts to them. To consider briefly how the importance of rhetoric has played out already, the series of announcements, orders, and plans put forth by California and New York in March offer comparable case studies. 

Part of the ongoing crisis is the concurrent infodemic—the proliferation of false or inaccurate information. Much has been said about steps taken in northern California to stop the spread ranging from commending their early action to accusing the local governments of inducing fear and panic by invoking the phrase: shelter in place. One caveat to this reporting is that during the press briefing for the most densely populated county (San Francisco) introducing Public Health Order No. C19-07, “shelter in place” was never uttered by any officials. It appeared in the language of the order as follows: “this Order requires all individuals anywhere in San Francisco to shelter in place—that is, stay at home—except for certain essential activities.”

![PersonalCollage](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/PersonalCollage.jpg) 

In this moment when every government is under the stress of acting quickly and efficiently, one approach to disseminating helpful information is to reuse known legal terminology. “Shelter in place” is a formal warning previously used in situations when it would be more dangerous for people to evacuate than stay indoors. Since the criticism of its inextricable association with more alarming circumstances, California switched to “stay-at-home order.”  

One of the loudest critics of naming public health orders came from New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo after New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio, expressed support for California’s action. “Look at your words, ‘shelter in place,’ you know where that came from? That came from nuclear war. What it said is people should go into an interior room of their home with no windows, stay there until they get the all-clear sign. Now, that’s not what people really mean, but that’s what it sounds like.” Instead, on March 20, Cuomo announced New York’s Executive Order, NYS on P.A.U.S.E., an acronym for Policies Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone.The regulations it outlined were built up over the month of March; gradually more of the non-essential workforce was sent home until the numbers reached 100%. The order also introduced stricter rules for vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly. Cuomo nicknamed this section Matilda’s Law, after his own mother, to act as a reminder that what an individual does affects those around them. Both the acronym (alternatively understood as the avoidance of using alarmist language concurrently circulating) and personal touches intend to present an empathetic approach, the efficacy of which is still running its course.  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxA4HL-I8sc" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>  

It could be argued that northern California was going to face backlash regardless of the formal language of their announcements because they introduced the strictest rules first. The rhetoric of the order, the press briefing, and subsequent reporting was one mere scapegoat for the anger, disappointment, and anxiety of the public. It is also worth questioning if the seriousness of the situation can and should be matched by the language used. The measures suggested at the Personal Scale, like maintaining six feet or working from home, feel somewhat voluntary (because they are in many places on the globe) despite having life or death effects. Further, political, medical, or scientific fields have historically attempted to use neutral, matter-of-fact tones to emphasize seriousness—like shelter in place—which is sufficiently vague. Using “stay-at-home” or stay home in its stead introduces a new, potentially contentious term: home. As the crisis continues, it is becoming increasingly evident that home can mean many different situations depending on individuals’ circumstances.

![FlattenTheCurveSocial](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/SocialCurve.png) 

The widely known diagram of “Flattening the Curve” takes terminologies like Social distancing, Quarantine, Isolation, Postponing and others as its base to highlight how social interaction influences the amount of stress put on the Healthcare system. Therefore, when annotating the “Flatten the Curve” diagram with a “Social Space” Lexicon approach, two additional layers come to mind. The first is the different levels of social distancing and how strictly each state or country applies them. We already know that depending on these different levels of social distancing, the Healthcare system will perform drastically differently. The wide known diagram highlights the huge difference between not doing anything and taking radical cautionary measures to reduce the spread of the virus. However the added curves highlight how measures that would seem drastic, are still not enough, like for example closing down schools and universities. Instead these added curves point out that only when isolating cases, plus any other additional effort, will we start seeing better results in containing the spread of the virus.  

The second layer is about how these different outcomes have an effect on vulnerable populations. This category includes both people who have pre existing conditions that make them more susceptible to the virus and certain age groups, but it also includes low-income populations who can not afford to isolate and stay home, or do not have the means to get tested and treated accordingly.  

![VulnerablePopulation](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/SocialVulnerablePop.png) 

It is therefore possible to make the following deduction: The first scenario of the “Flatten the Curve” diagram (in purple) most probably includes a much higher percentage of affected people that fall under any of the “vulnerable population'' categories, since they are the ones more likely to get it and not get an adequate treatment fast enough. This scenario shows a disregard for vulnerable populations which is also reflected in statements given by certain leaders, like Texas Governor, who considered “that the economic well-being of the country was more important than the lives of older people”. On the other hand, if the curve remains controlled, the second scenario in light blue, then the vulnerable population, meaning older people or groups with pre existing conditions, will still be mostly affected, but they will be able to get treatment, reducing their death toll. Unfortunately this was not the case for many cities and countries, in which the economy was put before the well being of their population.  

It is due to these many debates, on whether to do this or that, that talk around Social Space has become a very dominating topic since the start of COVID-19.   
The speed of the spread of the virus is currently dictating the way we interact in society. It has been constantly repeated that people who have the regular flu will spread it to 1.3 people, whereas someone with COVID-19 will give it to 2.5, meaning that our social behaviour needed to change drastically in order to avoid the exponential growth of the curve and avoid overloading the health infrastructure.  
With this concept in mind, a big variety of new terms started to become very popular ranging from basic social distancing understanding, to terms like “postponed” or “cancelled” that start travelling the media at exponential rates. A few weeks into the social distancing, people start talking about the “new normal”, anticipating and thinking of what the future might look like after this pandemic.  

![SocialLexicon](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/SocialLexicon.png)  

Of course all these new terms start to give shape to a broader one: “Infodemic”. It is as important as pandemic due to how fast and easily it “spreads”. The overwhelming amount of information and the easy access becomes the foundation of this one last term. Which is why the chronology of these terms is of particular interest. There is an order to how certain terms start to become more and more popular, also displaying how one leads to the next. 
In a way one can talk of an evolution of spatial terms that start to grow and diversify as time goes by since the start of the outbreak and as we see new outcomes, new reactions, unexpected growth in numbers and new social patterns.  

![LexiconGoogleSearch](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/SocialLexiconGoogleSearch.png)  

When running a Google Word Search for the U.S from December to May, we see that the terms that mostly stand out are Cancelled, Isolation, Shutdown, Social Distancing, Virtual and Essential Workers, all very related to Covid-19. However, even though it is hard to establish an actual chronological order, one could say that there is a “first” and a following chain reaction, starting with “Cancelled”. However, a Google Word Search will focus on trends, which does not accurately reflect the real order, which is why starting with “Essential workers”, due to their position as the frontline and first responders, can make more sense for a chronological collage.  
![LexiconChronologyGif](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/SocialLexiconChronologyGif.gif)  

There are many ways to organize this lexicon chronologically and probably none is entirely correct or incorrect. However this exercise allows us to raise important questions regarding the past present and future, questioning underlying issues that are now more visible, understanding the present, which is changing extremely fast under these circumstances and speculating about what will happen. For example, is there a new understanding of vulnerable populations that will include first responders or essential workers that cannot leave because they are needed, making them more vulnerable in a crisis like this?  Does this mean that these job positions could finally become more valued, leading to a raise in salary or social benefits? 
How will we continue using spaces? And are we learning new values and appreciating existing Social Networks? Maybe even discovering new ones that were always there but never evident?
All of this will finally lead to our New Normal.

![FlattenTheCurveUrban](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/UrbanCurve.gif) 

Typically the healthcare system’s available resources, space and staff all limit its capacity to treat patients. Urban areas with high populations and potential for Covid-19 spread create emergent needs to expand the healthcare systems capacity and mitigate high mortality by meeting increased needs--and fast. 

**Expanding Capacity**
Small local businesses and large corporations adapt in real time to provide online services and new production streams of PPE, medical equipment and provide basic needs to people around the world.  The distancing measures combined with temporary expansion to the healthcare system allow needs to be met and a delayed peak of cases. Re-openings of offices and normal operations and restrictions lifted before a vaccine or herd immunity risks a resurgence of the spread and a potential second peak. 

**Urban Space Transformation**
Quiet and eerily empty streets and public spaces. Makeshift hospitals spilling out into parking lots and parks. Caution tape strewn about playgrounds and signs reminding of “social distancing” and “no gathering, stay six-feet apart” displayed in places formerly packed on warm spring days.

Those depictions were unimaginable or seemingly science fiction prior to March. Urban spaces are undergoing reconfigurations which include temporary housing for the homeless, pedestrianized streets and makeshift treatment and testing centers. The streets are experiencing a beautiful resurgence of wildlife in some cases, but the inactivity can also create a post-apocalyptic fear and paranoia.

![UrbanLexiconGif](/conflict_urbanism_sp2020/images/covid19/UrbanLexiconGif.gif) 

**Imagining Potential Futures**
“Never waste a good crisis” has become a motto within the design field throughout the pandemic. The opportunities for change increase while each city experiences transformations. RFP’s and competitions have all launched to meet the challenges of a supposed “new future.” The hope is that we can adapt and customize our cities to work better for people. For far too long cities have been designed for automobiles and perform poorly for pedestrians and cyclists. People find themselves occupying the leftover area between the streets and the buildings--sidewalks. They are uninspired and wildly insufficient for our present reality of physical distancing which causes chaotic dodging on every block. What might the future urban spaces look like at the end of the Covid-19 crisis?

See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  



If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  


 

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  



<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
