#### What are carbon offsets?   

Carbon offsets are a form of trade; they are a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases (GHG) made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. When you buy an offset, you fund projects that reduce GHG emissions. These projects might include tree-planting, restoring forests, or increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. In an effort to combat climate change, individuals and companies can trade, or rather purchase offsets to assuage guilt, supposedly reduce their carbon footprint, and build up their green image.

#### Where did they come from? A brief history of carbon offsets   

In 1992-94, the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions as a result of anthropogenic activity, were explicitly formalized with the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). (1) The statement structured the culpability of “developed nations” as the largest contributors to climate change, and suggested an international economic framework that would fund carbon sink projects in all signatory countries.  
This financial legislation was later formalized in the Kyoto Protocol (1998), by designating specific obligations to developed countries, (2) and introducing the means by which equivalent emissions could be traded in order to fulfill commitments.  
The Paris agreement of 2015 introduced a new ecological and financial protocol that followed suit. Under Article 6, a series of policies allowed the emissions trading market to expand to the “developing” nations, suggesting the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes towards nationally determined contributions”. This became the norm, formally shifting the platform to investment in projects based in “developing” nations, as an ecological capital colonialism.  

*FOOTNOTES:  
1. As stated, the initial objective of the convention was to create a framework “to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” (UNFCCC, 9)  
2. Referred to as Annex 1 countries.*

In 2017, the US withdrew from the Paris agreement, in what is seen as a signature Trump action, but is actually consistent with the US position of economic strength over ecological commitments since the 1997 Byrd-Hagel Resolution. (3) This removal of a formal commitment enables the private emissions trading market in the US to blossom, outside of any central regulatory or government entity. As such, the market is constructed around a moral obligation or ecological conscience of consumer actions. “Carbon Offsets” as we know them, become a series of one-time payments, an unregulated vehicle for individuals and corporations to attempt to displace their obligation toward sustainability.  

*3. The Byrd–Hagel Resolution was a United States Senate Resolution stating that the US should not sign a climate treaty that would 'mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the Annex 1 Parties, unless ...[it]... also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing Country Parties within the same compliance period', or would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States. This effectively prohibited the US from ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.*

#### CASE 1: Delta to TIST   

By tracing the flow of capital inside carbon offset programs, we expose the space between claim and action. Our objective is to make legible, visible, and transparent the vocabulary of spatial and financial practices mobilized in the name of carbon emissions reduction. Through CASE 01, we will trace the flow of money from the Delta Airlines to remote agricultural territories, passing through carbon offset vendors and US christian missionary tree planting pyramid schemes.
