		<div id="title">Global Gaslink: The Right to Land, from First Nations to Multinational Corporations<div>

		<p id="text_1" class="text"><b>In Northern British Columbia, a First Nations territory in the Cariboo region, otherwise erased from the urban consciousness as part of Canada’s endless hinterland, has become the site of an ongoing international geopolitical conflict between traditional First Nations hereditary chiefs, the government of Canada, and the seemingly brute power of oil supermajors invested in resource extraction from the region. As the battle for control over rights to land use rages on, it brings with it another unseen catastrophe: Covid-19.</b></p>


		<p id="text_1" class="text">Demonstrations in Wet’suwet’en protesting the Coastal GasLink Pipeline project have been halted due to the pandemic, for the health and safety of the First Nations communities already rendered perilously vulnerable from a targeted history of infrastructural disempowerment. Remote First Nations communities are uniquely at risk from the novel coronavirus due to a combination of factors: unreliable access to rural healthcare facilities, a persistent and disproportionate lack of clean running water (many northern First Nations communities in Canada have been under decades-long boil water advisories), a longstanding history of intergenerational trauma inflicted by Canada’s Residential Schools program, and its resulting ongoing healthcare crises within. First Nations communities are particularly vulnerable to the devastation possible from the coronavirus due to disproportionate rates of the kinds of pre-existing health conditions known to render those infected with a more serious course of the disease.</p>

		<p id="text_2" class="text">While protests have stopped due to the pandemic, pipelines have been deemed by the Canadian government as critical infrastructure, with workers traveling into Kitimat and through the Cariboo region to continue with construction of the pipeline, leveraging the deadly disease as a menace against those who would otherwise not have been exposed to the virus. The Canadian government in partnership with the Coastal GasLink pipeline is essentially weaponizing Covid-19 by continuing to bring in workers from urban areas with widespread transmission of the disease to rural areas that would otherwise not have been exposed during the pandemic. Similarities to the smallpox epidemics of the late 18th- and 19th-centuries echo eerily in the background of this infectious disease. Intentional spread of the infectious disease decimated populations of First Nations communities across North America.</p>
